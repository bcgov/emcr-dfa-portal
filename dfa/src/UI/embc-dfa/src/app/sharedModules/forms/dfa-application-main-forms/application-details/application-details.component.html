                The Disaster Financial Assistance (DFA) Program operates under provincial legislation: <i>Emergency Program Act</i> and the <i>Compensation and Disaster Financial Assistance Regulation</i>.
                Emergency Management BC is obliged to provide DFA in accordance with this legislation. Section 8(1) of the Regulation states: “'eligible costs' does not include costs of expenses (a)
                recoverable at law of for which insurance was reasonably and readily available.”<br/><br/>
                <b>A DFA applicant who could reasonably and readily have purchased overland flood, water damage or water seepage insurance is NOT eligible to receive DFA.</b><br/><br/>
                “Readily available” means that a person could obtain this insurance from a local agent or broker. Also, we should not confuse reasonably available with affordable. What a person can
                afford is subjective and specific to that person. What is important is that the price of the insurance was reasonable considering the risk.
